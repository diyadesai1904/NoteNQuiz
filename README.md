üß† Smart Study Assistant: Text-to-Test AI
Project Overview
The Smart Study Assistant is a full-stack NLP project designed to transform lengthy study materials (PDFs or TXT files) into structured learning aids. The core of this application is a T5-small model fine-tuned for a complex multi-task learning objective, deployed via a professional and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

The application automatically performs three distinct NLP tasks on uploaded documents:

Abstractive Summarization: Converts large chunks of text into concise, cohesive study notes.

Factual Question Generation (QG): Creates short-answer quiz questions, with generated factual answers.

Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) Generation: Generates question stems, options, and the correct answer.

üöÄ Key Features
File Compatibility: Supports document upload in PDF (.pdf) and TXT (.txt) formats.

Customization: Users can select the desired Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and the Number of Questions to tailor the quiz output.

Multi-Task T5 Engine: A single T5-small model handles all generation tasks via unique input prefixes (summarize:, generate question:, etc.).

QG ‚Üí QA Pipeline (Frontend Fix): Solved the common T5 issue of non-factual answers by chaining two inferences for each question generated on the client-side.

üí° Technical Deep Dive (Overcoming Challenges)
Since the T5-small model was trained for only 2 epochs for rapid prototyping, the raw output was often extractive and unstable. The Streamlit application employs several key heuristics to ensure high-quality, reliable output without further retraining:

1. Robust Summarization
To fix the initial "starting content" bias, the app implements full-document chunking and stitching. The document is broken into ~250-word chunks, and the model processes and returns the summary for each chunk sequentially. The final notes are a compilation of these cleaned, condensed segments.

2. QG ‚Üí QA Inference Pipeline (Factual Answers)
To ensure the generated quizzes contain factual answers (rather than generic "short answer" prompts), the app executes a critical two-step chain for every question:

Question Generation (QG): The model is prompted (generate question: context: [chunk] answer: key concepts) to create a question.

Question Answering (QA): The generated question and the original chunk are immediately re-fed into the same T5 model as a Question Answering task (question and context: [Question] context: [Chunk]), forcing the model to generate the precise factual answer.

3. Stability and Filtering
The application uses strict Python filtering to handle output from the brittle T5-small model, ensuring:

Generated questions must contain a question mark (?) and start with a question word (Who, What, How).

Generated answers are cleaned of trailing punctuation and kept short (max 10 words).

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
You need Python 3.11+ installed.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your-Repo-Link]
cd smart-study-assistant

Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt 
# NOTE: You will need the dependencies listed below.

Required Files (Model Checkpoint)
For the application to run, you must have the fine-tuned T5 model and tokenizer files placed in the correct directory.

Place the following directory into the project root:

/smart-study-assistant
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notenquiz_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /final_notes_quiz_model/  <-- THIS FOLDER IS REQUIRED
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.safetensors
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spiece.model
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other T5 files)

Running the Application
Ensure all setup steps above are complete.

Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

streamlit run notenquiz_app.py

The app will open in your browser (http://localhost:8501).
